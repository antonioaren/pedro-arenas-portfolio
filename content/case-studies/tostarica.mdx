## Problem

Campaign traffic spikes; keep TTFB low and scale.

## Decisions

- Nuxt 3 + ISR; responsive images; CDN; critical routes pre-rendered.

## Architecture

- Nuxt 3 + TS; edge caching; route-level code splitting; CI/CD.

## Results (numbers)

- 500k+ monthly visitors, 0 downtime
- LCP ~1.8–2.4s // ⚠ to be confirmed
- CLS <0.1 // ⚠ to be confirmed

## My role

Frontend lead (perf budget, audits, pipeline).
